# Cloud-based-Big-Data-Systems-Project: Deploy a trained model to AWS Sagemaker real-time inference end-point
## Goals
* Use a major Big Data system to perform a Data Engineering related task
* Example systems could be:  (AWS Athena, AWS Spark/EMR, AWS Sagemaker, Databricks, Snowflake)

## Progress
 - [x] Configured Amazon SageMaker Studio domain
 - [x] Set up Amazon SageMaker Studio notebook
 - [ ] Create realtime inference end-point
 - [ ] Build a end-to-end inference pipeline
 - [ ] Upload and fetch model from Amazon S3 to interact with SageMaker
 - [ ]
